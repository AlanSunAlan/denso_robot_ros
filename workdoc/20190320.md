## Things done

1. import cobotta discription

2. use warehouse_ros_mongo package built from source (instead package warehouse_ros provided by ros)

this changed parameter pkg from "warehouse_ros" to "warehouse_ros_mongo" in file warehouse.launch line 10

## Issues

> [ERROR] [1553080074.135850]: Execution failed: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

this may be caused by warehouse.launch due to unsepecified parameter "moveit_warehouse_database_path"

> [ERROR] [1553080035.957341120]: Failed to motor on. (84500073)

this may indicate that the connection with cobotta controller has not been established

> [ERROR] [1553080051.802591987]: Action client not connected: cobotta/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory

this should be caused by the former issue
